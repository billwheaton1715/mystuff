With GitHub, you can log into the web interface and make one there.  Once you do, it gives you the right strings you need to use in the local Git bash shell to create a local repository, create a readme file there, add it to staging, and commmit it locally.  Then you do a `git remote add origin <url>` to give the alias 'origin' to the url.  Then you `git push -u origin master` to push the readme to the server.  At that point you can get onto github again and see the README.md file. (this file)</p> \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
